## Overview

Atheleia is an emotional regulator that synchronizes heart rate with music to progressively reduce anxiety, anger, or fear by gradually slowing down the music's BPM (beats per minute). In cases of sadness, it increases the heart rate to bring the user back to a baseline emotional state. The app also includes a diary feature where users can record their thoughts and feelings, which can be shared with their therapist. The therapist receives audio recordings, transcriptions, and detected irrational thoughts, allowing for better context understanding and treatment adjustments.  

## Features

* Audio Processing: Captures and processes audio input for sentiment analysis and classification and keep these audios as notes in a journal

* Generation Music: Using the heart beats per minute or (BPMs) generates audio with piano notes to help regulate altered modos, using MIDI files.

* Personal diary: keeps a personal diary of voice notes that are classified by sentiment and contain a description of detected irrational ideas
